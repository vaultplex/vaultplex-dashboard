// We need to bring the devnet Program deployed ID
// Also we need the types file and the IDL to provide a easier integration
// Then we need install anchor and initialize the anchor provider
// After that we will integrate the program methods in helpers so the react components can use them
// We need some UX for the creation. It should start with mockup data
// Link the UX buttons and list with the program data
// Also it's needed to add env variables with Program ID + Helius RPC
// Probably that's enough for the hackathon.
